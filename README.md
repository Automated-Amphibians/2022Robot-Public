The robot should be able to drive properly during teleop with this code (but should be tested if possible). A few changes have been made to try to stop the robot when it reaches a certain distance during autonomous. In autonomous with only TurnCommand(inches), someetimes the robot would do as told and stop after targetPosition is reached. But sometimes it would turn clockwise in circles.
