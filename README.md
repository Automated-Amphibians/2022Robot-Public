The robot still turns randomly when trying to move forward (same problem as before)

Autonomous 1: drop the cargo, turn around ~180 degrees, and move forward out of the tarmac

Autonomous 2: drop the cargo, turn around ~180 degrees, lower the arm, move forward, pick up another cargo, turn around ~180 degrees, raise the arm, move forward and score

Note: The drive speed in autonomous should be 40%, otherwise some calculations will be off

Autonomous 3 (work in progress): lower the arm, move forward out of the tarmac, pick another cargo, turn around ~180 degrees, raise the arm, move forward and score
