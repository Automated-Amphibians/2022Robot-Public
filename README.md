The robot moves pretty well. The arm and intake also works really well. The autonomous routine could be improved a bit more. Right now during autonomous, the robot will drop the ball from the intake, turn around clockwise ~180 degrees and move forward out of the tarmac. The climber should also be improved. Ideally the robot should be able to climb to the transversal bar, but that might be too hard. By the next competition, the robot should at least be able to climb to the high bar.
