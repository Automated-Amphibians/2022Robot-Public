The robot sometimes moves a bit weird, but the arm and the intake words really well. The main update is the autonomous routine. The robot now drops the pre-loaded cargo into the lower hub, turns around approximately 180 degrees, moves forward, picks up a cargo there, turns around back, moves straight to the lower hub and scores. This autonomous routine succeed a couple of times but when the auton speed is changed to make sure that the robot can do everything in 15 seconds, the robot couldn't turn back to the loewr hub accurately after picking up another cargo anymore.
