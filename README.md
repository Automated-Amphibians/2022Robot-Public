This code mostly works during autonomous and teleoperated period. The robot moves forward and backward both in autonomous and teleop pretty straight. The reason that you couldn't go forward or backward at the same time as  going right was because the leftFollower didn't follow the leftMaster. We had to specifically tell the leftFollower to run. We also did the same for rightFollower for consistency. All in all, the robot is in a really good shape right now. It can move all directions decently smooth. It only jerks a bit when coming out of a turn.
