The robot moves fine during teleop, but it might still turn around when it should go forward now and then. The intake and the arm work fine. The command group didn't really work. In autonomous, we can only move the robot forward and we can't add multiple commands in autonomous unless we can create more code to tell the robot to do the second command after the first one, otherwise it might execute all the commands at the same time.
