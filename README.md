The robot moves pretty well. The arm and intake also works really well. The autonomous routine could be improved a bit more. Right now during autonomous, the robot will drop the ball from the intake, turn around clockwise ~180 degrees and move forward out of the tarmac. We also might not be able to improve the intake much. The code allows the camera to send a video with a slight delay to the smart dashboard.
